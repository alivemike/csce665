<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">You are required to
finish this assignment individually. <br>
<br>
Write a program to reassemble telnet,&nbsp;ftp, and HTTP sessions.
Your program
should display for each telnet, ftp, and HTTP session, in ASCII format,
the
command/response interactions between the client and the server. You
may use C, C++, or Java for this assignment. <br>
&nbsp;* The input is a network trace. A sample pcap trace with
telnet and ftp sessions is
available <a href="tfsession.pcap">here</a> for
your test. A sample HTTP trace is <a href="httpsession.pcap">here</a>.
We may use another trace (ftp/telnet/http) to test your submitted
program. <br>
&nbsp;* The interactions you need to display is NOT at packet
level, but application level. <br>
&nbsp;*
The output format is up to you; however, the output must be ascii
readable, so convert any unreadable characters to some numeric value
(e.g., %u, %d). And you may need to combine/assemble multiple packets
in a single response.<br>
&nbsp;* You may need to consult the relevant RFCs for the
tcp/telnet/ftp/http protocols.<br>
&nbsp;*
You can use <a href="http://yuba.stanford.edu/%7Ecasado/pcap/section1.html">libpcap</a>
library in your program (more tutorial <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.winpcap.org/docs/docs_41b5/html/group__wpcap__tut7.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Eee122/fa07/projects/p2files/packet_parser.c">here</a>; java version <a href="http://jnetpcap.com/">here</a> or <a href="http://jpcap.sourceforge.net/">here</a>).
You can refer to
existing open source projects (e.g., tcpdump, snort, bro) and modify
them according to
your purpose.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Your submission should include:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Compilable source code of your
solution for the assignment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A report describing everything I
should know to be able to test your solution, as well as detailed design, debug, experience, any of your
finding/conclusion, and any thoughts, lessons.<br>
